## STUDENT SCORE PREDICTION

This project focuses on predicting a student’s academic score based on various input factors such as study hours, previous performance, attendance, and other relevant features. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes patterns in historical student data to estimate expected scores with good accuracy.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the complete workflow of a machine learning pipeline—data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and prediction. It serves as a beginner-friendly example for understanding regression problems and applying supervised learning algorithms in real-world educational scenarios.

This project is ideal for students who are new to machine learning and want hands-on experience with a simple regression problem using real-world style data.
